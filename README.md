# Image-Classification using CNN

## Project Overview

In this project, we will classify images from the dog-vs-cat-images-data dataset on kaggle notebook. The dataset consists of  dogs, cats images. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. We will normalize the images,  build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, we will see the predictions on the sample images.
